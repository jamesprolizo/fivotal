=Fivotal=

Fivotal is a plugin for FitNesse that allows you to pull information about a story from PivotalTracker.

==Getting Started==

After either downloading or compiling the fivotal.jar file, place it in the same directory as the fitnesse.jar.

Create a fivotal.properties like the one included in this project and update the configuration:

api.key=<pivotal_api_key>

<team_name>.id=<pivotal_project_id>

Now start FitNesse the following way:

On Mac:

java -cp fitnesse.jar:fivotal.jar fitnesseMain.FitNesseMain -p 8080

On Windows:

java -cp fitnesse.jar;fivotal.jar fitnesseMain.FitNesseMain -p 8080

==Usage==

!pivotal{project_id,story_id}

where project_id is the Pivotal Project ID (i.e. 50021) and story_is is the story ID (i.e. 6011234)
